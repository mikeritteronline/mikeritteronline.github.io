<h2>The Art of Web Design</h2>

<p>Web designers bring a set of skills and experience to the table that set their projects above others. As a web designer I've learned the fundamental elements that set a good website apart. One may play the guitar faithfully and skillfully, but an <em>artist</em> applies that skill to <em>creating</em> something inherently <em>more</em>. Likewise, we <strong>create something with unique value</strong> when web designers build a website.</p>

<h2>Tailor-made Solutions</h2>

<p>As a free-lance web designer I create tailor-made solutions for my clients. From a targeted marketing campaign to a complete brand package, the end product is made to suit my clients' specific needs. Off-the-shelf options bring immediate gratification, but can feel inadequate. Working with a professional web designer is like buying a suit or gown cut to fit by a craftsman who understands what makes a high-quality product.</p>

<h2>A Small-scale Approach</h2>

<p>I take a cue from small-scale local farmers. Their products are often preferred because they refuse to cut corners to produce cheaply and quickly. Instead, they prepare the land, cultivate their crops, and harvest at the peak of ripeness. They understand mass-market produce isn't necessarily the <em>best</em>; sometimes less-attractive varieties have more flavor or better texture.</p>

<p>This small-scale approach to web design begins with understanding my clients, their goals, their audience,  and their competitors. I run through several versions before landing on a final product. Like the farmer, through careful cultivation we are rewarded with a rich and ripe final product.</p>

<h2>First Step</h2>

<p>Are you ready to begin creating your own tailor-made website with a professional web designer? No idea is too big or too small to get started. It  all begins with a one-to-one consultation to discuss your idea and solutions that may suit your goals.</p>
